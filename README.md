# Touchless Webpage Scroller

A browser extension that allows users to scroll webpages without touching their devices. This uses a [**Tensorflow**](https://www.tensorflow.org) handtracking library which tracks the hands of the user so they can scroll up or down by simply raising their hands. Raising one hand will scroll the page down and raising two hands will scroll the page down.
